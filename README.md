# Description
Maestra (codename) is an immersive experience infrastructure platform. It allows you to connect any device to a central bus, publish and subscribe to events, connect devices in a P2P network for efficient transfer of data, and integrate with any show control system. A vibrant plugin ecosystem allows for the development of custom, high-performance modules in Python, Rust or C++, so you can build any immersive experience you can dream up.

"We build tools for creatives."
"Maestra gives you permission to create what you're dreaming."
